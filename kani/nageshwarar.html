        <p><h3>Aditya Chola constructed this temple during the 9th century.
        It is great marvel of Chola architecture, building technology and astronomy.
         The orientation is structured in such a way that it allows sunlight inside
         the temple, right on the sanctum only during the Tamil month of Chithirai.
         The temple is one of the prominent Shiva temples in Kumbakonam.The temple
          shows early Chola art in its best form particularly in the form 
          of human figures..</h3>
